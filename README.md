👋 Hello I’m @fefe33...

👀   I am a cyber security student who is interested in developing my programming skills.

🌱   I am currently focussing on infrastructure and applications security. I am pretty new to programming (give or take a year+), but I try to spend alot of my free time working on various projects.

💞️   I have alot of interests. but not necessarily the time (or skillset) to pursue all of them.

📫 How to reach me --> will add at later date.
