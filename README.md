👋 Hello I’m @fefe33...

👀   I am a cyber security student who is interested in developing my programming skills.

🌱   I am currently focussing on applications security. I am pretty new to programming (give or take a year+), but I try to spend alot of my free time working on various projects.

💞️   i like to build web apps (and break them), play with code, and learn about how technology works. sometimes i play with Software defined radio as a hobby, but my EE knowledge is very limited.

I find computer science fascinating, and i think it is a beautiful feat of engineering the way so many different componenets and little circuits can work together to perform such complex tasks. i also find that there are few things as satisfying as when your script finally works. i hope one day to get a real job in tech.

📫 How to reach me --> will specify at a later date.
