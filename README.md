👋 Hello I’m @fefe33...

👀   I am a cyber security student who is interested in developing my programming skills.

🌱   I am currently focussing on infrastructure and applications security. I am pretty new to programming (give or take a year+), but I try to spend alot of my free time working on various projects.

💞️   I have alot of interests. but not necessarily the time (or skillset) to pursue all of them. these include but are not limited to (basic) Web Development, radio technology and communications, electronics/EE, and mathematics. 

I find computer science fascinating, and i think it is a beautiful feat of engineering the way so many different componenets and little circuits can work together to perform such complex tasks and computations. I want to try and work to understand how this technology works on as low a level as I can before its my time to go. I also hope to have the opportunity to work on some awesome projects.

📫 How to reach me --> will specify at a later date.
