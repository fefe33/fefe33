👋 Hello I’m @fefe33...

👀   I am a cyber security student who is interested in developing my programming skills in python and javascript.

🌱   I am mostly interested in development and security in OSI layers 7 - 3, and I am pretty new to programming (give or take a year+), but I try to spend alot of my free time working on various projects.

💞️   my first big project is my homepage application. details (will be) contained in the README in that file. 

📫 How to reach me --> will add at later date
